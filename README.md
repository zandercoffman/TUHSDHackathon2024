# TUHSD Hackathon 2024
* Project created by Zander Coffman, Kiretan Amin, Daniel Briggs, and Darius Collins in the advanced division.
## Focus:
* Our game is called "Spaced Out", an educational game designed to teach users about the solar system.
* For our project, we used Unity as our game engine, Audacity as our audio editor, and more to be listed.
## How To Use?
* The only folder in the current directory you see, <em>"Hackathon2024"</em> is a folder that needs to be opened via Unity Hub.
* Once you have that done, you're welcome to use our project.
